# api-database-engineering
This project is a part of the [DataScience Bootcamp](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/data-science-bootcamp/) at [WBS Coding School](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/).   Other datascience projects can be found at my [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/tobiasaurer).

#### Project Status: In Progress

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to learn dealing with API's and JSON files.   
Data had to be requested, structured, and visualized. 
A database will be built in mySQL Workbench based on the data.

### Methods Used
* API-Calls 
* Data Engineering
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
  * pandas, jupyter, requests (api)
* Matplotlib

## Project Description
The data gathered is freely available:
* Weather Data -> [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/).  
* Airport Data -> [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/aedbx-aedbx/api/aerodatabox/)
  
Main goals of the project:  
* Access weather and airport data via API-requests
* Structure the incoming data to make it usable 
* Create some basic visualisations

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Make sure to have the following libraries environment:
  * pandas
  * requests
  * matplotlib
3. Create an account at [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) and insert your API-key in [api_keys.py](https://github.com/tobiasaurer/api-database-engineering/blob/main/api_keys.py)
4. Create an account at [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/aedbx-aedbx/api/aerodatabox/) and insert your API-key in [api_keys.py](https://github.com/tobiasaurer/api-database-engineering/blob/main/api_keys.py)
5. Visualisations are saved [here](https://github.com/tobiasaurer/api-database-engineering/tree/main/visualisations)
